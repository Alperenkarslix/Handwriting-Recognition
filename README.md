Handwritten character recognition systems have a wide potential for use in various industries and application areas. These systems can be used in many areas such as document classification, automatic text transcription, and handwriting-based search. Focusing on the Turkish alphabet, this study aims to develop a deep learning model for the recognition of Turkish handwritten characters.

The literature on handwritten character recognition is an area where deep learning methods are widely used. Deep learning stands out with its ability to recognize complex patterns on large data sets, and this feature can increase the success of character recognition systems. This study aims to fill the gap in the literature on Turkish handwritten character recognition.

The literature review has shown that similar studies are generally focused on the English alphabet. However, the theses and studies found and examined after scanning various thesis sites will be indicated in the Source section.

After this introduction, the literature review and methods used sections will provide a detailed description of the developed Turkish handwritten character recognition system. The training data, model architecture, and the obtained results will be discussed in detail in this document.
